kamaiti
=======
People of South Asia have used this system for generations. They pool their money every month and use it to pay for large expenses. At the end of the "kamaiti" cycle, everyone will have paid into the pool exactly what they received during it.

For example, 12 people decide to each pay $100 per month into the pool, for a total of $1200. Each month, a participant receives $1100 (plus their own contribution of $100). At the end of the year/cycle, each participant paid $1200 into the pool and received $1200.

This may seem counterintuitive at first. A person could save $100 per month for a year and get the same result as participating in a kamaiti. The difference, though, is that a person could get and use $1200, say in February, instead of waiting for December (if they saved the money themselves). You may think of it as a loan with no interest, and you pay it back within the cycle. Of course, the length of the cycle, number of participants, individual contribution, size of the pool, etc., can be tweaked according to the needs of the participating group.

This project aims to create a management interface for people to easily create and manage kamaiti groups.
